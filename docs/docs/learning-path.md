# Learning Path for LangGraph.js

This learning path provides a structured way to learn LangGraph.js, from beginner to advanced topics. Follow this path to gain mastery of building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.

## üî∞ Beginner: Getting Started

Start here if you're new to LangGraph.js:

1. [Introduction to LangGraph.js](index.md) - Understand what LangGraph.js is and its core concepts
2. [Quickstart Tutorial](tutorials/quickstart.ipynb) - Build your first graph in minutes
3. [Core Concepts](concepts/high_level.md) - Learn about graphs, nodes, edges, and state

### Choose Your API Style

LangGraph.js offers two different API styles for building graphs. Understanding the differences will help you choose the right approach for your project:

- [StateGraph vs Functional API](concepts/functional_api.md#comparison-with-stategraph) - Learn the key differences between the two approaches
  - **StateGraph API** - Object-oriented approach with explicit graph construction
  - **Functional API** - Cleaner, more concise approach using JavaScript functions

> **Which should you choose?** If you prefer a more explicit, visual representation of your graph with clearly defined nodes and edges, use StateGraph. If you prefer a more concise, functional programming style with less boilerplate, choose the Functional API. 
>
> **Good news**: You can mix both approaches! Graphs built with StateGraph can call Functional API graphs, and vice versa. This flexibility allows you to use whichever approach works best for each particular component of your application.
